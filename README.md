# Open Family Policy Program (OFPP)

The OFPP represents codified maternity, paternity and parental leave legislation in 28 European Countries between 2013 and 2019. It can be combined with EU-SILC cross-sectional data to create a collection of policy variables: leave eligibility, leave duration, and cash benefits. For more information about the Program see **_Methodology_report_eusilc_cs_v.0.2_** file in this Repository.

# To run the Program:
1. merge the original EU-SILC CS files using **_SD_merge_eusilc_cs.do_** 
    - this step can be omitted if you already have a merged EU-SILC cross-sectional file
3. add your DATA directory in **_MAIN_eusilc_cs.do_**
4. add your CODE directory in **_MAIN_eusilc_cs.do_**
5. if you already have your merged EU-SILC file, add the name of the data file into **_MAIN_eusilc_cs.do_**
6. run **_MAIN_eusilc_cs.do_**
